You can search for weather in a city by typing just the name of the city and hitting the "Compare Weather" button.\
Or you can search the weather in two cities, by typing the name of the first city in where it says, "Enter city 1"\
and typing the name of the second city in where it says, "Enter city 2".\
Then push the "Compare Weather" button.
